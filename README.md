## Time spent on the assignment:

### It took me around 16 hours to finish the assignment. I worked on it over several days, trying to make sure everything was done properly and that I understood what I was building.

## Challenges faced during the lab:

### There were a few parts of the lab that I found particularly challenging. One major difficulty was working with CSS. It took considerable time and effort to get the layout and design to look the way I intended. Sometimes, styles didnâ€™t behave as expected, and I had to experiment and research various solutions to resolve those issues.
### Another challenge was implementing local storage. I initially struggled with properly storing and retrieving data.
